# Cloud Computing Specialization

## Overview

The Cloud Computing Specialization is a set of six courses, consisting of lectures, readings, challenging programming assignments and culminated in a larger project. The aim of this report is to present the key takeaways of what I've learned and to document my experience in working through the courses. The courses were my first time working with cloud / distributed computing. I have previously studied operating systems via "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces", networking via "Computer Networking: A-Top-Down Approach" and algorithms via "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python", all of which were very useful in working through the material and doing the assignments.
